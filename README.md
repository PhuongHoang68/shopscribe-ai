## Description

Full-stack MERN + AI-powered application designed to help new Etsy sellers launch and grow their shops by generating professional, high-converting shop and product content in minutes.

The app streamlines branding, marketing copy, SEO, and visual design suggestions — all in one dashboard.

### User Story
                As a new Etsy seller, 
                I want an AI-powered content creation tool 
                So that I can quickly set up a professional and attractive shop without spending hours on copywriting or design.

### Acceptance Criteria
                GIVEN an Etsy seller AI assistant web app
                WHEN I sign in with Google or email
                THEN I can navigate to the Shop page to input my product type, target audience, price point, and brand positioning
                WHEN I submit the Shop form
                THEN I receive AI-generated shop name ideas, banner/icon visuals, shop announcements, shop policies, thank-you email templates, and a brand color palette, with options to open Canva or Ideogram for editing visuals
                WHEN I navigate to the Product page
                THEN I can enter product details (type, audience, tone, aesthetic, pricing strategy)
                WHEN I submit the Product form
                THEN I receive AI-generated product titles, descriptions, SEO tags, pricing ideas, and customer review/thank-you messages, with an option to open PlaceIt for mockups
                WHEN results are generated
                THEN the form collapses but can be toggled with "Show Form"
                WHEN I revisit the app
                THEN my past results are saved and can be accessed via "View Recent Search"
